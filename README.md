# ðŸš€Microsoft_Malware_Detection - binary classification

This repository contains research for binary classification use case.

The target will be the last HasDetections column, which takes the values {0, 1} in the absence or presence of a virus on the computer, respectively. The features will be various characteristics of the computer.

## DATA Review
In this assignment we will work with Microsoft Malware Detection data.

## Brief Overview of the Files:
### 1. requirements.txt
Before running code locally please install dependancies from requirements.txt

### 2. research/microsoft_malware_detection_disb.ipynb
Main research file

### Metrics: f-score

### what was done:
1. LogisticRegression with L2 regularisation
2. Selected a threshold that maximizes recall, provided that precision > 0.6.
3. Our classifier finds at least 20% of computers with a virus, among all truly infected computers
4. LogisticRegression vs LinearSVC

As a result, LogisticRegression model turned out to be the best for this task
